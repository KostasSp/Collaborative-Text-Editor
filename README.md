This collaborative text editor project emulates google docs; a random room ID is created when the user visits the home page, which can then be shared with other users (by sharing the URI), who in turn can add, edit or delete text. All new inputs are sent to the server, which then immediatelly broadcasts the changes to every instance of the text editor that shares the same room ID, providing a real-time collaborative work space.

The Quill.js text editor is used for this app, which is known to be vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. To mitigate the risks, data sanitisation is implemented (both on client and server), in order to prevent malicious scripts reaching the server. This is especially important in this app, where the server immediatelly shares whatever is sent to it with other users.

Some steps to improve performance are taken; instead of polling the database continuously, guard clauses first check whether the current text editor contents match the contents of the object fetched from the database on page load, hence preventing unnecessary updates.
